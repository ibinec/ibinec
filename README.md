Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Claude and I am interested in all things data and machine learning systems. I am currently working as a Data Engineer and located in Nashville, TN. In my free time, I like to read, hike, travel, and explore different music genres over a cup of tea (In no particular order).

Check out my Portfolio for all of my projects, micro-projects, skills, certificates, and achievements.
